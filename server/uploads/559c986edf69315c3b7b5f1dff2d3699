<p align = "center">Ah the one bridge I have yet to cross. With a microcosm of a lack of effort and ability, a lack of results is the only sensible result. It isn’t that I don’t want to be in a relationship, quite the opposite. I simply fear the steps I would have to take to approach one. Once someone is settled into a routine, breaking that routine and out of one’s shell in the process is a major change. It requires a certain level of confidence and spontaneity that I do not possess. I feign a lack of interest in the prospects of a relationship, I want to take it slow, I want the right person, it's all a shield. It's easier to hide behind excuses than to admit your own faults and insecurities. You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take, but missing a shot is a lot more intimidating than never taking one at all, at least for now. It's unfortunate really, I feel that the happiness a relationship would provide would make things much easier, at least that's what my optimism tells me. In reality, such an ideal love doesn’t exist. Most of the time there's issues, disagreements and heartbreak. By the end you think to yourself, was it worth all the trouble. Yes, it always is and always will be. I understand that yet I continue to torture myself by refusing to take a step forward. Staying in the same place is no different than moving backwards, as the world moves forward all the same. Even then I speak of taking the leap as a guaranteed path to success, which is true in a sense, but not right away, especially for someone like me. I’m lazy, and would rather have everything handed to me by the world. I’ve never had to work for something, strive for something, and at this rate, if I continue to be content with my life, I never will. I speak of these topics as if I have some infinite wisdom and understanding, but the truth is that I’m too immature to see the fault in my ways, or at least too much of a coward to take initiative. Change is necessary, but for that, the will to change must be ever-present, or even fleeting, but it's always been lacking, in the very essence of my being.</p>
