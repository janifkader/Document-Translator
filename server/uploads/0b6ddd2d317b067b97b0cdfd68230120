<p align= "center" class = "intro">Ah, the coveted blog. Not really a blog since its not public, maybe that makes it even creepier as the only person I'm talking to is myself. Regardless, I feel every human, one way or another, needs an outlet. A space to vent out their frustrations, a space where they can truly be their real, ugly selves. This often expresses itself creatively, as is the case for me. I hope I won't regret this too much, as I do the rest of the decisions in my life, but enough with the melodrama and enough with this introdction.</p>
